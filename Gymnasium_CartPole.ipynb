That is do we exploit our prior knowledge gained during learning and move according to what we currently have calculated as the best action for a given state or do we explore and select a different action in the hopes of finding a better route/set of actions?\n",

        "At the beginning As Q gets better and better with progressive training we slowly decrease $\\epsilon$ more and more according to a decay rate. This changes the policy to go from a higher ratio of exploration, to a higher ratio of exploitation.\n",

        "    1. Make **more efficient use of the experiences** during the training. Usually, in online reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment, gets experiences (state, action, reward, and next state), learns from them (updates the neural network), and discards them. This is not efficient.\n",

For instance, if the agent is in the first level and then in the second, which is different, it can forget how to behave and play in the first level.\n",
