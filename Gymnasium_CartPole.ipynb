That is do we exploit our prior knowledge gained during learning and move according to what we currently have calculated as the best action for a given state or do we explore and select a different action in the hopes of finding a better route/set of actions?\n",
        "\n",
        "We use an **epsilon greedy policy** where $\\epsilon$ represents the probability of exploration (selecting a random action) and $1-\\epsilon$ represents the probability of exploitation. $\\epsilon$ is a number from 1-0.\n",
        "\n",
        "At the beginning As Q gets better and better with progressive training we slowly decrease $\\epsilon$ more and more according to a decay rate. This changes the policy to go from a higher ratio of exploration, to a higher ratio of exploitation.\n",

        "* There is also an additional feature of an **experience replay** which has two functions:\n",
        "    1. Make **more efficient use of the experiences** during the training. Usually, in online reinforcement learning, the agent interacts with the environment, gets experiences (state, action, reward, and next state), learns from them (updates the neural network), and discards them. This is not efficient.\n",

        "        * **catastrophic forgetting**: The problem we get if we give sequential samples of experiences to our neural network is that it tends to forget the previous experiences as it gets new experiences. For instance, if the agent is in the first level and then in the second, which is different, it can forget how to behave and play in the first level.\n",
